# InternshipTask

For my pre-internship task at BEIA, I created a "Temperature and Humidity" IoT based system that integrated various technologies to monitor and visualize environmental data in real-time. The project collected room readings, processed it and presented actionable insights through advanced tools like Grafana, Node-RED, and blockchain.

Key Activities:

 IoT and MQTT Integration:
 Configured an MQTT broker to collect temperature and humidity readings from a DHT11 sensor.

 Node-RED Development:
 Utilized Node-RED for flow-based data processing.
 Designed a pipeline to retrieve, process, and publish data back to the MQTT broker.

 Data Visualization with Grafana:
 Connected Grafana to InfluxDB for real-time environmental data visualization.
 Implemented alert systems to notify users of specific conditions via email.

 Telegram Chatbot Development:
 Created a chatbot to provide instant updates on environmental data.

 Blockchain Integration:
 Explored smart contracts on a test blockchain platform to automate actions based on data thresholds.

 Dockerized Deployment:
 Built a Docker image for deploying an ArrowHead-based component.
 Used containerization to ensure consistent deployment across environments.

Technologies Used:

 Programming Languages: Python, Arduino
 Tools: Node-RED, Grafana, Telegram API, Docker.
 Protocols: MQTT.
 Database: InfluxDB
 Blockchain Platform: MultiversX Testnet.
